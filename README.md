# Fast-Plant-Classification-on-a-Robotic-Application
This report covers implementation of the transfer learning approach to classify the two plants. This is done by grabbing a frame of the plant from the camera and classify correctly. The robot is operated by joystick to move and the camera is fitted infront of the bot. The dataset has been re-trained on different pre-trained models and evaluated. The training process is done on a local machine and for the inference on the model is tested on Nvidia Jetson Nano Platform.

The sample dataset is given in this repository, complete dataset can be accessed in the below link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJplUuwzZiTiS6toWRiD0V9sytP4EFSC?usp=sharing
